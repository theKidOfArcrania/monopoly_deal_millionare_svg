# Monopoly Deal: Millionare SVGs

![Sample card images](/MillMonopolySS.png)

These are SVGs made as a derivative of the Monpoly Deal: Millionare card set.

Some of the cards are not actually the same (mostly to avoid obvious trademark
issues), but remain equivalent

Hasbro pls don't sue me :(

## Building
Run `make all` to generate all the images. You need to have inkscape and python
installed (with pyyaml python package)

## FAQ
**Q: What does W stand for?**

The unit stands for Worker's compensation units, of course!
